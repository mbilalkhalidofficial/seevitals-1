# DSMEGlobal

SeeVitals Technologies is an ambitious project brought to life by 3 friends that have recognized the dire need of technological interventions in the healthcare industry. 2 doctors having worked in numerous healthcare setups from around the world understood that the need to optimize the role of nurses and allied hospital staff remained crucial. Especially in ICUs (Intensive Care Units) and HDUs (High Dependency Units), where time was of the essence. While shifting their focus from their individual clinical practices to a solution best fit for both hospital staff and their patients, the idea started taking shape during a mutual hospital management degree.
We felt that the time taken for clerical work (patient charting, hourly recordings, etc.) could be better utilized and patient care can thus be improved. Hereâ€™s where our computer scientist came in. With thorough experience in the field and an existing network with the health industry alike, Dayyan proposed to introduce a technology that could cater to the nurses and doctors as well as improve patient risk assessment and bed throughput time.
